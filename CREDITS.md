# Credits

Below are all external assets used in "Progression and Multiple Solutions", the second group project of team 3 in GSND 6250.

All external assets are used under the restrictions set by the instructor of this class and clearly credited in this file.
None of them are functional, and most of them are for implementing the designed visual languages.

All listed entries are either directly included in the project's `Assets` folder, or their derived versions are used and the original versions are in the `Original External Assets` folder.
